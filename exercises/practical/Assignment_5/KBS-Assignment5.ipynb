    "* For doing this, apply preprocessing on the data: Discretize attributes as needed\n",
    "* Experiment with several quality functions: Briefly compare the results, and discuss your findings\n",
    "* Experiment with different algorithms (beam search, SD-Map), and compare their runtimes. What do you observe?"
