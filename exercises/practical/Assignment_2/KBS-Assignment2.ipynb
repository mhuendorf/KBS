    "## Exercise 02.01: Simple Diagnostic Scores\n",
    "* (Again) Read the paper \"Martin Atzmueller, Joachim Baumeister, and Frank Puppe. Semi-Automatic Learning of Simple Diagnostic Scores utilizing Complexity Measures. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 37(1):19–30, 2006.\" (also discussed in the lecture): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365705000862\n",
    "* Build on the implemention (you can of course your implementation) of the data structure diagnostic profile - relating to the description in the paper.\n",
    "* From assignment 01: The class should have an (internal) method build which takes a dataframe, a list of diagnoses, and list of findings (in the form of the respective attributes) and constructs the according diagnostic profile object. You can, for example, implement this as a static method of the class, or use the respective instance method being called from the constructor of the class (for instantiating the object)\n",
    "* From assignment 01: For this class, also implement a method prune(...) which takes an integer for removing infrequent findings\n",
    "* Your class should contain a method learn(...) which learns the set of diagnostic scores (according to the method presented in the paper), respecting the given thresholds. Design the interface of your class/methods accordingly, e.g., such that the respective thresholds can be specified.\n",
    "* For this you should create a new class DiagnosticScore which captures the simple diagnostic score pattern (simple finding -> solution relation); use this for representing diagnostic scores\n",
    "* Test your implementation, via reading in and applying your implementation on this dataset: \n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer\n",
    "* Here, you can consider the class attribute for the different diagnoses (i.e., consider the individual values of the class attribute as such).\n",
    "* Implement a method printScores() which prints the learned scores (for debugging/diagnostic purposes) in tabular format.\n",
    "* Also provide an according getter method for the learned set of diagnostic scores.\n",
    "* For the diagnostic profile class, create a method \"classify\" which takes a row of a dataframe (e.g., from the test dataset above) and outputs the most likely class according to the obtained diagnostic score values. Here, implement the aggregation of scores in such a way, that, for example, for S1, S2, S3 - S1 accounts for half of S2, S2 accounts for half of S3, and that any a score larger than S2 (larger -> \">\", not \">=\" (!)) \"establishes\" the specific class\n",
    "* Test your implementation - comparing the performance of the classification with the given class contained in the data, by printing out the \"classified solution\" and the \"correct solution/class\"."

    "Neural Cymbolic Computing is a strategy where Neural Networks are combined with symbolic representation of knowledge, in order to be able to both learn efficiently and robustly as well as reason from what has been learned. The symbolic knowledge makes it more understandable for humans and the neural networks can be used to infer on this knowledge.\n",

On top of that it offers techniques to prevent overfitting and increase learning efficiency when dealing with small amounts of learning data, as well as techniques for automatik knowledge extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Symbolic Computing has the advantage of encompassing numerous techniques like the previously mentioned horizontal hybrid learning to improve learning with small datasets. On top of that, the increased understandability also makes it a lot esier to directly control and affect the learning process in intentional ways, like using previous knowledge encoded as parameters to improve learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of Neural Symbolic Computing are not as numerous, but constructing a neural smybolic system instead of another AI system comes at the cost of needing to decide both for the symbolic knowledge representation as well as needing a sufficient amount of training data, making more effort necessary compare to some systems. On top of that the neural network part can give room to more errors compared to a well constructed purely symbolic system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges of neural symbolic computation include challenges of specific techniques like propositionalisation generating irrelevant clauses. More generally, it is unclear what the best approach for constructing a neural smybolic system. Approximating satisfiability in neural symbolic reasoning is another challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "An exemplary technique is horizontal hybrid learning, where prior symbolic knowledge is taken from networks or experts, encoded into a neural network, and used to improve the efficiency of learning and to prevent overfitting.  The prior knowledge is encoded as controlled parameters that directly affect learning. In knowledge transfer learning, the symbolic knowledge is extracted from one domain and then applied to learning of a neural symbolic system a related domain."

The core idea is, given a node $X$, find all nodes reachable from $X$ by following edges forward. Then, find all nodes reachable from $X$ by following edges backward (i.e., following edges against the arrow.) Finally, intersect those two sets. That will be the set of nodes in $X$'s strongly connected component, because if $Y$ is in both these sets, you can follow the edges forward from $X$ to $Y$ and then since there is also a backwards path from $X$ to $Y$, there is a forward path from $Y$ to $X$, so you can get from $X$ to $Y$ and back to $X$ following edges forward.\n",
