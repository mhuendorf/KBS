    "## Exercise 02.01: Simple Diagnostic Scores\n",
    "* (Again) Read the paper \"Martin Atzmueller, Joachim Baumeister, and Frank Puppe. Semi-Automatic Learning of Simple Diagnostic Scores utilizing Complexity Measures. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 37(1):19â€“30, 2006.\" (also discussed in the lecture): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365705000862\n",
    "* Build on the implemention (you can of course your implementation) of the data structure diagnostic profile - relating to the description in the paper.\n",
    "* From assignment 01: The class should have an (internal) method build which takes a dataframe, a list of diagnoses, and list of findings (in the form of the respective attributes) and constructs the according diagnostic profile object. You can, for example, implement this as a static method of the class, or use the respective instance method being called from the constructor of the class (for instantiating the object)\n",
    "* From assignment 01: For this class, also implement a method prune(...) which takes an integer for removing infrequent findings\n",
    "* Your class should contain a method learn(...) which learns the set of diagnostic scores (according to the method presented in the paper), respecting the given thresholds. Design the interface of your class/methods accordingly, e.g., such that the respective thresholds can be specified.\n",
    "* For this you should create a new class DiagnosticScore which captures the simple diagnostic score pattern (simple finding -> solution relation); use this for representing diagnostic scores\n",
    "* Test your implementation, via reading in and applying your implementation on this dataset: \n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer\n",
    "* Here, you can consider the class attribute for the different diagnoses (i.e., consider the individual values of the class attribute as such).\n",
    "* Implement a method printScores() which prints the learned scores (for debugging/diagnostic purposes) in tabular format.\n",
    "* Also provide an according getter method for the learned set of diagnostic scores.\n",
    "* For the diagnostic profile class, create a method \"classify\" which takes a row of a dataframe (e.g., from the test dataset above) and outputs the most likely class according to the obtained diagnostic score values. Here, implement the aggregation of scores in such a way, that, for example, for S1, S2, S3 - S1 accounts for half of S2, S2 accounts for half of S3, and that any a score larger than S2 (larger -> \">\", not \">=\" (!)) \"establishes\" the specific class\n",
    "* Test your implementation - comparing the performance of the classification with the given class contained in the data, by printing out the \"classified solution\" and the \"correct solution/class\"."

    "* Below, we consider the problem of finding (strongly) connected components in a directed graph.\n",
    "For this, we can use the $edge(X, Y)$ predicate, such that this is true if there is an edge between nodes $X$ and $Y$. Let us assume we have a node and we want to find all the nodes that are in the same connected component as the given node. So, given a node $X$, find all those nodes $Y$ that are reachable from X and from which you can get back to X.\n",

    "\n",
    "* However, we can provide a more efficient version, since this problem can be solved in $O(e)$ time. The core idea is, given a node $X$, find all nodes reachable from $X$ by following edges forward. Then, find all nodes reachable from $X$ by following edges backward (i.e., following edges against the arrow.) Finally, intersect those two sets. That will be the set of nodes in $X$'s strongly connected component, because if $Y$ is in both these sets, you can follow the edges forward from $X$ to $Y$ and then since there is also a backwards path from $X$ to $Y$, there is a forward path from $Y$ to $X$, so you can get from $X$ to $Y$ and back to $X$ following edges forward.\n",
