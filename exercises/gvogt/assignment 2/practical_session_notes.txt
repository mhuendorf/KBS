Horizontal Hybrid learning
When not enough data for deep learning is available, prior symbolic knowledge could be taken from
other networks or experts and encoded into a neural network. This can improve efficiency of learning and 
prevent overfitting. The training process is changed so that the logical knowledge are used as parameters 
that affect the training.

In knowledge transfer learning, one kind of horizontal hybrid learning, symbolic knwoledge from a domain is extracted 
and then transfered to improve learning in a related domain.
